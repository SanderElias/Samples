# Signals, watch the effect.

**YOU SHOULD AVOID EFFECTS**. which is something you hear a lot.
Yeah, easy said, but _why_? And aside of the why, _how_?

In your code you need to react to things coming from (input)signals, and you need to react to them.
An effect seems to be 'the way', and is very alluring.
But it is not the way, it is a way, and it is a way that is very hard to get right.
In this talks I will explain why you should avoid effects, and teach you some ideas on how to avoid them.
And I'll show you some code that is not using effects, and is still very readable and maintainable.
