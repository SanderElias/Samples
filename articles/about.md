# Whats this all'bout?

This is my little corner of the web. You have found my "blog".
That's a big word for wat it is. Its a collection of markdown files I wrote.
I wanted a place where I could finally put them all. And share them. Mostly with my friends and colleagues. But if you find it interesting, feel free to read along.
