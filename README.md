# Sanders Samples project

This is my mono-repo where I do quick experiments and samples. Also, this is where I keep my public libraries. Usually this is kept on the latest versions off all packages, and the source in here is experimental. Also it's only targeting evergreen browsers. 
Code is provided as-is, and there are no guaranties.

I'm using `yarn` in this repo.

## first step

The samples use some of my personal libraries, those are also in this mono-repo, and you need to build them before the sample will work
you can do so bu running:
```bash
yarn build.lib
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve samples` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
